# AI Documentation Assistant

## Problem Description
This project provides a simple AI-powered assistant to query and search documentation.

## System Overview
The system consists of a frontend UI, a backend API, and an MCP server providing AI tools.

## AI-assisted Development
AI tools were used to assist with coding, structuring the project, and documenting the system.

## MCP Usage
An MCP server is used to expose tools for querying documentation content.

## Technologies & Architecture
- Frontend: Minimal HTML UI
- Backend: FastAPI
- AI / MCP: FastMCP
- Containerization: Docker

## Frontend
The frontend provides a simple interface to submit queries to the backend API.

## API Contract
The API is defined using an OpenAPI specification.

## Backend
The backend implements the API using FastAPI and follows the OpenAPI contract.

## Database
A lightweight SQLite database is used for persistence.

## Containerization
The entire system can be run using Docker and docker-compose.

## Testing
Basic unit and integration tests are included for core functionality.

## Deployment
The application can be deployed to a cloud provider (e.g. Render or Fly.io).

## CI/CD
A CI pipeline runs tests automatically on each push.

## Reproducibility
Clear instructions are provided to run the system locally using Docker.
